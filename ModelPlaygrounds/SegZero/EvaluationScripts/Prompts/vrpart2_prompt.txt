Please find "{Question}" with bounding boxes and points from the given image.
Your goal is to output tight bounding boxes and a representative point.

GENERAL RULES:
- Output tight, compact boxes with minimal extra background.
- The representative point must lie inside "{Question}"
- If nothing matches the query, output [] for the relevant JSON lists.
- The query may refer to a whole object or a part of an object. If the query is about a part, you should first think about and find the whole object that contains the part , then find the part within that object.

You MUST follow these steps and output structure.

STEP 1 — Think
In <think> </think> tags, think about:
- What the query is asking for.
- Whether it is a whole object or a part.
- Where it is in the image.

STEP 2 — Decide if you are finding an object or a part
In <target> </target> tags, output either “object" or "part"
- "object": the query is about a whole object.
- "part": the query is about a part of an object.

STEP 3 — If <target> is a “part”, locate the object to which the part belongs
- If <target> is "part", first find the whole object(s) that contain the part. In <object_hint> </object_hint> tags, output a JSON list of these object boxes:
[{{"bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "point_2d": [cx, cy]}},...]
If <target> is “object”, inside <object_hint> tags output a single empty list: [] .

STEP 4 — First Answer
In <first_answer> </first_answer> tags, output a JSON list of the boxes for what the query directly refers to, that is "{Question}":
[{{"bbox_2d": [px1, py1, px2, py2], "point_2d": [pcx, pcy]}},...]
- If <target> is “object”, these boxes should cover the whole object.
- If <target> is “part”, these boxes should cover only the part (not the entire object). The part should be within the object boxes in <object_hint>.

STEP 5 — Criticism (Self-Check)
In <criticism> </criticism> tags, you will check your first answer. What do the boxes in <first_answer> enclose? They should tightly enclose "{Question}\”.  If adjustments are needed, describe the issue and suggested adjustments. Example of necessary adjustments could be to make the bboxes smaller or bigger, or move the bboxes in any direction.
The last part inside <criticism> MUST be exactly one of:
- "ADJUSTMENT: YES"
- or “ADJUSTMENT: NO"
Output "ADJUSTMENT: NO”  if the boxes and points in <first_answer> are correct and no adjustments are necessary. Output "ADJUSTMENT: YES" if the <first_answer> needs adjustments to enclose "{Question}"
Examples:
- "<criticism>...The box is already tight and correctly placed. ADJUSTMENT: NO</criticism>"
- "<criticism>...The box is slightly too large and shifted down; I will move it up and shrink it. ADJUSTMENT: YES</criticism>"

STEP 6 — FINAL ANSWER
In <answer> </answer> tags, output the final answer.
- If <criticism> ends with "ADJUSTMENT: NO":
  - The JSON list in <answer> MUST be IDENTICAL to the JSON list in <first_answer>.
- If <criticism> ends with "ADJUSTMENT: YES":
  - At least one bbox_2d or point_2d in <answer> MUST be different from those in <first_answer>,
    and the changes should counter the entire <criticism> and incorporate the adjustments.
The <answer> should contain a JSON list of entries with bbox_2d and point_2d.
[{{"bbox_2d": [qx1, qy1, qx2, qy2], "point_2d": [qcx, qcy]}},...]

OUTPUT FORMAT EXAMPLE (STRUCTURE ONLY):
<think>thinking here</think>
<target>object|part</target>
<object_hint>[{{"bbox_2d": [x1,y1,x2,y2], "point_2d": [cx,cy]}}, // additional boxes if found] | []</object_hint>
<first_answer>[{{"bbox_2d": [px1,py1,px2,py2], "point_2d": [pcx,pcy]}}, // additional boxes if found]</first_answer>
<criticism>criticism here. ADJUSTMENT: YES|NO</criticism>
<answer>[{{"bbox_2d": [qx1,qy1,qx2,qy2], "point_2d": [qcx, qcy]}}, // additional boxes if found]</answer>
